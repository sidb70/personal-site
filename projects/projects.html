    <p>Here are some of my side projects I've worked on outside of school. I've used these projects to learn 
        new technologies and frameworks that are not taught in my undergraduate classes.

        <li class="project">
            <a href="https://github.com/sidb70/move-master" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Move Master (Spartahack)</a>
            <p class="date">Jan 2023</p>
            <p class="desc">Move Master is a bodyweight form checking application. It is implemented using TensorFlow 
                Blazepose to generate 3D points of joints and calculates angles between these points to judge 
                exercise form. Written in TypeScript and React. Group project for Spartahack 8 hackathon</p>

        <li class="project">
            <a href="https://github.com/sidb70/slope-stat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slope Stat</a>
            <p class="date">Dec 22 - Jan 23</p>
            <p class="desc">Slope Stat is a web application that allows users to view ski resort data (such as lift and trail statuses, snowfall, base depth, etc.) in a centralized manner. 
                I made this project because I got tired of going to multiple websites to decide which mountain to go to. Backend implemented with a GraphQL API written in Node.js, MongoDB, and Python to scrape data.
                Front end not complete.
