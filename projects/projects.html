    <p>Here are some of my side projects I've worked on in and out of school. I've used some of these projects to learn 
        new technologies and frameworks that are not taught in my undergraduate classes. Others I have included because I find them interesting.
    </p>
    <ol class="project-list">
        <li class="project">
            <a href="https://github.com/sidb70/move-master" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Move Master (Spartahack)</a>
            <p class="date">Jan 2023</p>
            <p class="desc">Move Master is a bodyweight form checking application. It is implemented using TensorFlow 
                Blazepose to generate 3D points of joints and calculates angles between these points to judge 
                exercise form. Written with TypeScript and React. Group project for Spartahack 8 hackathon</p>
        </li>
        <li class="project">
            <a href="https://github.com/sidb70/Algorithm-Engineering-Course-Project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Algorithm Engineering Research</a>
            <p class="date">May 2023</p>
            <p class="desc">This is the course research project for MSU's CSE 431: Algorithm Engineering, taught by Dr. Kevin Liu. The project involved running 4 different 
                experiments comparing various sorting algorithms and data structures. This was the first research project I've done in computer science and I thought it was 
                pretty fun. Definitely one of my favorite classes thus far in my undergraduate studies</p>
        </li>
        <li class="project">
            <a href="https://github.com/sidb70/slope-stat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slope Stat</a>
            <p class="date">Dec 22 - Jan 23</p>
            <p class="desc">Slope Stat is a web application that allows users to view ski resort data (such as lift and trail statuses, snowfall, base depth, etc.) in a centralized manner. 
                I made this project because my friends and I got tired of having to check multiple resort sites to decide on a mountain to ski/snowboard at. Backend implemented with a GraphQL API written in Node.js, MongoDB, and Python to scrape data.
                Front end not complete.
